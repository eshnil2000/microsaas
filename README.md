## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node ^4.2.3, npm ^2.14.7
- [Bower](bower.io) (`npm install --global bower`)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and then `gem install sass`
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (`npm install --global grunt-cli`)
- [bloc](http://github.com/blockapps/bloc) ('npm install -g blockapps-bloc@1.1.1-beta2')

### Up and running
1) Install the blockapps commandline tool bloc

2) create a new bloc project `bloc init`


4) Run your bloc server

5) Now run the app app

6) Create saas!

### Developing

1. `npm install`

2. `bower install`

3. `grunt serve` 

#### Simulate Saas Service
run the script repeat.sh
change the user account numbers, and the contract account numbers
based on the new users & contracts you create


####Write up from devpost
Inspiration
We want to free users from vendor lock in, allows switching vendors on the fly depending on the use case, performance demands & verifiable proof of vendor service level.

What it does
a marketplace to aggregate micro consumable APIs across multiple cloud vendors like MSFT, IBM, Amazon and multiple service providers like db as a service and storage as a service.

How we built it
This App is Built on Azure Blockapp blockchain instance using Blockapp development stack using Javascript & Jquery.

Challenges we ran into
Development stack in infancy, several hacks required to get the full stack up and running with the blockchain and smart contracts.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Persistence! Took idea to proof of concept, got a demo up and running in less than 15 hours.

What we learned
Blockchains are fun and useful at the same time, but coming up with a compelling/ killer app is tough

What's next for MicroSaas
Take proof of concept to the next stage, connect the project to web services, build a marketplace.

Built With
jquery
javascript
blockchain
